# This is a repository to run ZeroTier Agent or Controller on VyOS router
# You can run only Agent or only Controller; You can run both
# I guess its not a good idea to attach an agent to the controller that runs on the save VyOS

# To make it work first install docker container app on VyOS
# Then install either controller or agent containers on your VyOS

#After each VyOS update you must re-run these scripts
